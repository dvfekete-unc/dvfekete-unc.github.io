            <h3>Coronavirus in the U.S.: Latest Map and Case Count</h3>
            <p>More than 3,600 people with the coronavirus have now died in the United States, </br>
                according to a <b>New York Times database,</b> a figure that has more than tripled since </br>
                Thursday morning and that now exceeds the number of people known to have died from </br>
                the virus in mainland China, where the pandemic started in December.

                a cheerful and funny video game for the Nintendo Switch that has become a social-media </br>
                sensation in the era of social distancing. The premise is simple: You’re tasked with </br>
                transforming a small, cartoony island into a bustling village. There is no kidnapped </br>
                princess or planet on the brink of war, but you get to go outside, which is even better. </br>
